Excel Aging Report
The excel template(Aging Report.xlsm and Database.xlsx) is an Accounts Receivable Aging Report template that will help categorized accounts receivable by how long invoices have been outstanding. Using powerquery in excel. I connected the Aging Report.xlsm file to Database.xlsx to shape the data. I also use macro VBA to easily refresh the data connection and also to update the pivot tables for the aging report.
