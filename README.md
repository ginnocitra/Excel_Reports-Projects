The excel template(Aging Report.xlsm and Database.xlsx) is an Accounts Receivable Aging Report template that will help categorized accounts receivable by how long 
invoices have been outstanding. Using powerquery in excel. I connect the Aging Report.xlsm file to Database.xlsx to shape the data. I also use macro VBA to easily refresh the data connection and also to update the pivot tables for the aging report.
